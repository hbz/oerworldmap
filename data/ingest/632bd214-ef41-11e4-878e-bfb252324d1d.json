The BBE was originally developed in 2011 by a group of educators from 14 small states. Together they have contextualised the course, taking into consideration the needs of each institution and country.</p><p>The programme is set to launch in 2015 and will be the first time that the Trinidad and Tobago Accreditation Council (ACTT) has ever accredited a programme developed using open educational resources (OER). ROYTEC’s former Executive Director, Mr Earl Browne, welcomed the new programme, noting that \"the BBE was developed using OER materials, thus giving ROYTEC [the ability] to integrate OER into their institution, [helping] to bring down the cost of programme development, which [will] also be passed on to the learners. I believe the BBE programme will have a successful outcome.\"</p><p>COL’s Education Specialist for VUSSC, John Lesperance, also commented that \"the ROYTEC approach to implementing the BBE and using OER is proving to be an excellent case study for COL, and VUSSC is going to use this model to replicate it in other small states.\"</p><p>This programme opens the doors for future OER courses to be accredited by the appropriate bodies.</p>"
