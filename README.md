![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/hbz/oerworldmap.svg)

For inital background information about this project please refer to the
[Request for Proposals](http://www.hewlett.org/sites/default/files/OER%20mapping%20RFP_Phase%202%20Final%20June%2023%202014.pdf).

## Setup project

### Get Source

    $ git clone git@github.com:hbz/oerworldmap.git
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

### Setup Elasticsearch

#### [Download and install elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/elkdownloads/)

    $ cd third-party
    $ wget https://download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-1.3.6.zip
    $ unzip elasticsearch-1.3.6.zip
    $ cd elasticsearch-1.3.6
    $ bin/elasticsearch

Check with `curl -X GET http://localhost:9200/` if all is well.
    
#### Configure elasticsearch

If you are in an environment where your instance of elasticsearch won't be the only one on the network, you might want
to configure your cluster name to be different from the default `elasticsearch`. To do so, shut down elasticsearch and
edit `cluster.name` in `third-party/elasticsearch-1.3.6/conf/elasticsearch.yml` and `es.cluster.name`
in `conf/application.conf` before restarting.

#### Create and configure oerworldmap index (as specified in `es.index.app.name` in `conf/application.conf`)

    $ curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/oerworldmap/ -d @conf/index-config.json

#### If you're caught with some kind of buggy index during development, simply delete the index and re-create:

    $ curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9200/oerworldmap/
    $ curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/oerworldmap/ -d @conf/index-config.json

#### Optionally, you may want to [install the head plugin](https://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head)

    $ cd third-party/elasticsearch-1.3.6
    $ bin/plugin -install mobz/elasticsearch-head

### Setup Play! Application

Download [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html), then
