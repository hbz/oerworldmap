# Vision & Goals

The OER World Map shares information on behalf of the worldwide OER community, using local knowledge to describe the OER ecosystem. Built with cutting edge linked open data technology, OER World Map collects and visualizes information about actors, activities and resources from the field of OER. Our goal is to provide the most complete and comprehensive picture of the global OER movement and to develop a global network of partners and volunteers to guarantee ongoing data curation.

## The OER World Map is
- a tool to collect and store data by, about and for the OER community
- a set of tools to visualize the data
- open to contribution by individuals and institutions
- built on state of the art linked open data technology
- aiming at maximum openness, connectivity and reusability
- owned and driven by the OER community.

## The OER World Map can be used
- to find and contact OER experts
- to find OER services in order to use them for learning
- to find OER services in order to develop technical infrastructure like search engines
- to connect institutions and foster inter institutional cooperation
- in many other ways.
