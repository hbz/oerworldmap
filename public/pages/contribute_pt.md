## Raise awareness

### Spread the news

People need to know about the OER World Map if it is to provide a comprehensive overview of OER people and activities. We need to build the network together, so please speak to your friends and colleagues or use social media to reach out more widely (use [#oerworldmap](https://twitter.com/hashtag/oerworldmap)).

### Become a Country Champion

Developing the OER World Map depends upon collaboration. It will be built best by a network of Country Champions who will have or want to create an overview of the OER movement in their own country. From their local base they will raise awareness with their connections, gather data and assure its quality.

Many countries do not have a Country Champion yet. More information on the OER World Map Country Champion Network can be found on our [blog](https://oerworldmap.wordpress.com/2015/09/19/how-to-become-part-of-the-oer-world-map-country-champion-network/). If you or your institution could play this role please write to <in&#102;o&#64;oerw&#111;&#114;ldma&#112;&#46;org>.

### Contribute stories

We have much to learn from each other. Please consider sharing a story describing your - project or initiative - Open Educational Practice - research and new insights on OER - development or use of infrastructure tools.

A short text with lessons learned – what worked and what did not – would contribute to understanding of the different ways that OER are created and used. Please note that stories will be published under [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you have an OER story which you consider worth sharing, please register yourself and add it to the OER World Map!

### Translate the web pages

To become a truly global resource, OER World Map web site pages need to be available in multiple languages. If you would be able to translate web pages into your native language please let us know at <in&#102;o&#64;oerw&#111;&#114;ldma&#112;&#46;org>.
