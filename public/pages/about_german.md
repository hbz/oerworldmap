## Die Vision

Seit mehr als 10 Jahren werden stetig mehr Open Educational Resources (OER) geschaffen und verwendet. Die OER World Map sammelt und veranschaulicht Daten zur wachsenden Zahl der Aktuere und Aktivitäten im Bereich der offenen Bildung weltweit. Ihr Ziel ist es, die Entwicklung des OER-Ökosystems zu beschleunigen, indem sie ein möglichst umfassendes und aktuelles Bild der OER-Bewegung zeigt. Die dargestellten Informationen können für ganze verschiedene Zwecken verwendet werden, beispielsweise:

- verschienen Aktuere miteinander vernetzen, um Zusammenarbeit zu erleichtern und um Wissen und Resourcen zu teilen
- Listen von Repositorys und anderen OER-Services bereitstellen, um Lehrern und Lerneneden zu helfen, passende Bildungsmaterialien zu finden
- Entscheider unterstützen, stratigischen Entscheidungen zu treffen und zu verteidigen, durch aussagekräftige Statistiken und Überblicksdarstellungen zur OER-Bewegung und deren Auswirkungen

Die OER World Map soll Informationen bereitstellen für die selbstorganisierte Entwicklung der OER-Bewegung. Sie erfasst und zeigt relevante Organisationen, Projekte, Personen und Services. Gleichzeitig unterstützt die Plattform das Netzwerken, das Finden von OER-Sammlungen und das Treffen von Entscheidungen. Als Ganzes kann die OER World Map als eine Art "Steuerzentrale" für die Open Education Community gesehen werden.

Die OER World map wird entwickelt von [hbz](http://www.hbz-nrw.de) und [graphthinking GmbH](http://www.graphthinking.com) in Verbindung mit der [Open University (UK)](http://www.open.ac.uk/) gefördert von der [William and Flora Hewlett Foundation](http://www.hewlett.org/). Aber sie gehört der weltweiten OER-Community. Durch den Einsatz und die Ideen auf lokaler Ebene und ein globales Netz von Partnern und freiwilligen Helfern wird die OER World Map aufgebaut und aktuell gehalten werden als Ressource für alle.

Philipp ([@boesephil](https://twitter.com/boesephil) on Twitter) is a Java developer in the field of Computational Linguistics (CL). After having worked with search engines, parsers, neural networks and speech synthesis in the course of his CL studies at the University of Cologne he went on to gain general IT experience at a German 1000 head counting, Java focused company. Later on he worked as a backend developer in an Gardner Magic Quadrant American eDiscovery company, finally heading for the open minded spirit of the University-related hbz again. He is deeply convinced of the WWW to serve for the common welfare and therefore being open and truly loves to work on a project he severely identifies with.

### Karin Driesen (Online Editor)
![Karin Driesen](/assets/images/Karin-Driesen-130.jpg)
Karin started to work for the OER World Map at hbz in spring 2016 as online editor. Before this she worked for the German office of O’Reilly Media, a computer book publisher known for supporting the open source community. She has studied two extremely different subjects: German literature and geoecology. These subjects were related to different ways of studying: reading and writing on your own studying literature and working together as a team by sharing all resources with your fellow geoecology students. Getting material written by other people, refine it and pass it on to the following students was much like the OER way. She wants to  move ahead on this way and help people to find useful and reusable information.
