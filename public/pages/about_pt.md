## The Vision

For more than a decade the creation and use of Open Educational Resources (OER) has been increasing around the globe. The OER World Map collects and visualizes data on the growing number of actors and activities in the field of open education worldwide. The goal is to accelerate the evolution of the global OER ecosystem by providing a comprehensive and responsive picture of the OER movement. The information provided can be used for a wide range of purposes, including:

- connecting actors with each other facilitating co-operation and sharing of resources and knowledge
- providing qualified lists of repositories and other OER services to help teachers and learners find educational resources relevant to them
- supporting policy makers in taking and defending strategic decisions by providing meaningful statistics and overviews of the open education movement and its associated impacts

The OER World Map is intended to provide the information needed to support the self-organization processes of the OER movement. In addition to mapping relevant organisations, projects, people and services, the platform provides social networking, allows the identification of OER collections, and supports decision making. Taken together, the OER World Map can be seen as a kind of ‘operations room’ for the open education community.

The OER World Map is being built by [hbz](http://www.hbz-nrw.de) and [graphthinking GmbH](http://www.graphthinking.com) in association with [The Open University (UK)](http://www.open.ac.uk/) funded by [The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation](http://www.hewlett.org/). But it belongs to the global OER community. With input and intelligence from local sources and a global network of partners and volunteers, the OER World Map will be built and updated – a resource for all.

## Team

### Philipp von Böselager (Back-End Developer)

![Philipp von Böselager](/assets/images/image05.png) Philipp ([@boesephil](https://twitter.com/boesephil) on Twitter) is a Java backend developer in the field of Computational Linguistics (CL). After having worked with search engines, parsers, neural networks and speech synthesis in the course of his CL studies at the University of Cologne he went on to gain general IT experience at a German Java focused company. Later on he worked as a backend developer in an eDiscovery company, finally heading for the open minded spirit of the University-related HBZ again. He is deeply convinced of the WWW to serve for the common welfare and therefore being open and truly loves to work on a project he severely identifies with.

### Karin Driesen (Online Editor)

![Karin Driesen](/assets/images/Karin-Driesen-130.jpg) Karin started to work for the OER World Map at hbz in spring 2016 as online editor. Before this she worked for the German office of O’Reilly Media, a computer book publisher known for supporting the open source community. She has studied two extremely different subjects: German literature and geoecology. These subjects were related to different ways of studying: reading and writing on your own studying literature and working together as a team by sharing all resources with your fellow geoecology students. Getting material written by other people, refine it and pass it on to the following students was much like the OER way. She wants to move ahead on this way and help people to find useful and reusable information.
