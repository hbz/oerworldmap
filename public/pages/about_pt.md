## A Visão

Por mais de uma década a criação e uso de Recursos Educacionais Abertos (REA) tem aumentado em todo o mundo. O Mapa Global REA coleta e apresenta dados sobre o crescente número de atores e atividades no campo da educação aberta em todo o mundo. O objetivo é acelerar a evolução do ecossistema global de REA, oferecendo um retrato abrangente e ágil do movimento REA. A informação fornecida pode ser usada para uma ampla gama de propósitos, incluindo:

- conectar atores, facilitando a cooperação e a partilha de recursos e conhecimentos
- fornecer listas qualificadas de repositórios e outro serviços REA para ajudar professores e alunos a encontrar recursos educacionais relevantes para eles
- apoiar decisores em tomar decisões estratégicas e defendê-las fornecendo estatísticas relevantes e perspectivas gerais do movimento de educação aberta e impactos associados

O Mapa Global de REA destina-se a fornecer informações necessárias para o apoio à auto-organização dos processos do movimento REA. Além de mapeamento de serviços, projetos, pessoas e organizações relevantes, a plataforma fornece uma rede social, permite a identificação de coleções de REA e oferece suporte a tomada de decisão. Tomado em conjunto, o Mapa Global REA pode ser visto como uma espécie de "sala de operações" para a comunidade de educação aberta.

O Mapa Global REA está sendo construído pela [ hbz](http://www.hbz-nrw.de) e [ graphthinking GmbH](http://www.graphthinking.com), em associação com [ The Open University (Reino Unido)](http://www.open.ac.uk/), financiado pela [ William e Flora Hewlett Foundation](http://www.hewlett.org/). Mas o Mapa pertence à comunidade global de REA. Com a inserção de dados e a inteligência de fontes locais e uma rede global de parceiros e voluntários, o Mapa Global REA será construído e atualizado – um recurso para todos.

### Philipp von Böselager (desenvolvedor de Back-End)

![Philipp von Böselager](/assets/images/image05.png) Philipp ([@boesephil](https://twitter.com/boesephil) on Twitter) is a Java backend developer in the field of Computational Linguistics (CL). After having worked with search engines, parsers, neural networks and speech synthesis in the course of his CL studies at the University of Cologne he went on to gain general IT experience at a German Java focused company. Later on he worked as a backend developer in an eDiscovery company, finally heading for the open minded spirit of the University-related HBZ again. He is deeply convinced of the WWW to serve for the common welfare and therefore being open and truly loves to work on a project he severely identifies with.

### Karin Driesen (Editor on-line)

![Karin Driesen](/assets/images/Karin-Driesen-130.jpg) Karin Driesen trabalha como editora online do Mapa Global REA. Before this she worked for the German office of O’Reilly Media, a computer book publisher known for supporting the open source community. She has studied two extremely different subjects: German literature and geoecology. These subjects were related to different ways of studying: reading and writing on your own studying literature and working together as a team by sharing all resources with your fellow geoecology students. Getting material written by other people, refine it and pass it on to the following students was much like the OER way. She wants to move ahead on this way and help people to find useful and reusable information.
