<b>What is this website?</b>\
\
The OER World Map shares information on behalf of the worldwide OER community, using local knowledge to describe the global OER ecosystem with statistics, timelines, and stories. Built with cutting edge linked open data technology, OER World Map visualizes the world of OER and supports a range of widgets and tools with powerful statistical analysis. OER World Map is built by <a href="https://www.hbz-nrw.de/">hbz</a> and <a href="http://www.graphthinking.com/">graphthinking GmbH</a> in association with <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">The Open University (UK)</a> with funding from <a href="http://www.hewlett.org/">The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</a>.\
\
<b>What is OER? </b>\
\
'OER' stands for 'Open Educational Resources' and this refers to freely accessible materials that can be used for a range of activities around teaching and learning. These can include textbooks, multimedia content, curricula and assessment materials, lessons plans, data sets and other materials. What makes them open is typically an <a href="”http://opendefinition.org/guide/”">open licence</a> instead of a traditional copyright licence.\
\
The <a href="http://www.hewlett.org/programs/education/open-educational-resources">Hewlett Foundation</a> believes that OER “offer an extraordinary opportunity for people everywhere to share, use, and reuse knowledge" and defines OER as:\
<blockquote>...teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property license that permits their free use and re-purposing by others. Open educational resources include full courses, course materials, modules, textbooks, streaming videos, tests, software, and any other tools, materials, or techniques used to support access to knowledge.</blockquote>\
Though this definition provides good orientation, the concept of OER still remains ill defined in many regards when looking at it more in detail. For example it is still open to discussion, if an open file format is an essential characteristic of OER. Also it has to be understood better, what distinguishes an Open Educational Resource from “usual” open contents like those provided by Wikipedia or Flickr.\
\
Since the concept is still in development the OER World Map project will take a rather broad approach providing information about actors and activities from the field of OER in the strict sense of the term, but also about related subjects like Open Education, Open Access and MOOCs.\
\
If you want to learn more about the history and use of OER then a useful video playlist is provided by <a href="http://oerresearchhub.org/2013/09/25/understanding-oer-in-10-videos/">OER Research Hub</a>.\
\
<b>Who is this website for?</b>\
\
The OER World Map provides helpful information for everyone who is interested in or connected to OER and Open Education. The fact, that the platform will provide data and information with relevance to literally every stakeholder group from the field of OER makes the project fascinating, but also provides a major challenge for designing the system in a user orientated way without losing focus on the needs of the key target groups.\
\
During this phase of the project (which will be ongoing till November 2015) we will focus on three main use cases ("epics"):\
<ul>\
	<li>Teachers and learners should be provided with a qualified list of OER services (e.g. repositories) in order to help them finding OER resources more easily</li>\
	<li>OER initiatives should be supported in their communication by finding OER experts and projects working on similar tasks</li>\
	<li>OER policymakers should be supported by statistics derived from the database</li>\
</ul>\
The OER World Map addresses end users as well as other OER institutions and services. While the former probably will use the GUI, the latter might be more interested in reusing the included data via our API.\
\
Our use cases are collected on <a href="https://github.com/hbz/oerworldmap/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Astory">GitHub</a>." If you think anything is missing here, please tell us so!\
\
<b>How can I participate in OER World Map?</b>\
\
There are many ways to get involved! The success of the project will highly depend on the participation of the OER community. The most important ways to contribute are:\
<ul>\
	<li>Contributing stories</li>\
	<li>Becoming a country champion</li>\
	<li>Collecting data using our input templates (planned for Sept. 2015)</li>\
</ul>\
But there are many other ways of contributing to project. A complete overview can be found on our <a href="”https://beta.oerworldmap.org/contribute">contribute</a> page.\
\
<b>What kind of information does OER World Map collect?</b>\
\
The OER World Map collects data about actors and activities related to OER and Open Education. During phase II (which is going till the end of 2015) we will not collect information about specific OER (like documents collected in a repository), but concentrate instead on the infrastructure around OER. Particularly we are interested in:\
<ul>\
	<li>organizations</li>\
	<li>projects</li>\
	<li>services</li>\
	<li>persons</li>\
	<li>events</li>\
</ul>\
The resulting data set will provide answers to many questions like “Where can I find OER?” or “Which projects are working on a similar topic to our project?” or “Which experts have the knowledge to answer a question related to a special area of OER?”.\
\
We believe that this set of data is also of special importance, since it will provide a solid foundation for every future attempt to collect knowledge about OER and Open Education in a systematic way. It is very easy to think of ways to expand the model in the future. For example we are planning to include Open Educational Practicses (OEP), OER policies and tools used to build services in the next phase of the project.\
\
A frequently heard misunderstanding is that the OER World Map will include direct access to individual resources. We believe that the discovery of individual OER has to be provided by search engine based services. Nevertheless the OER World Map will help to discover OER by providing a qualified list of OER services.\
\
<b>What is an open license?</b>\
\
The widely accepted OER definitions by The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and UNESCO require the use of a special licence, which transforms a conventional educational resource into an open educational resource. Though the wording is slightly different (Hewlett speaks of "... a property license that permits their free use and re-purposing" while UNESCO requires that materials are "...released under an open license that permits no-cost access, use, adaptation and redistribution by others with no or limited restrictions” ) both definitions mainly refer to the same kind of licenses, which are commonly named "open licenses".\
\
Depending on the licence this allows for a range of behaviours sometimes known as the <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/3221">'5 Rs' of openness</a>:\
<ul>\
	<li>Retain – the right to make, own, and control copies of the content</li>\
	<li>Reuse – the right to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a video)</li>\
	<li>Revise – the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (e.g., translate the content into another language)</li>\
	<li>Remix – the right to combine the original or revised content with other open content to create something new (e.g., incorporate the content into a mashup)</li>\
	<li>Redistribute – the right to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (e.g., give a copy of the content to a friend)</li>\
</ul>\
A slightly different focus is provided by the Open Definition which states that:\
<blockquote>“Open data and content can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose”</blockquote>\
Though there are many different open licenses available, <a href="”https://creativecommons.org/licenses/”.">Creative Commons</a> provides the by far most used open licence family.\
\
Creative Commons provides at the time being six different licenses. Unfortunately, it is still not yet completely agreed in the OER community which licenses are open in the sense of OER. In order to reassure the possibility to adapt material while trying to exclude a minimal number of initiatives, following licenses are considered to be open in the context of the OER World Map project:\
<ul>\
	<li>CC BY</li>\
	<li>CC BY-SA</li>\
	<li>CC BY-NC</li>\
	<li>CC BY-NC-SA</li>\
</ul>\
We generally strongly recommend to use CC BY or CC BY-SA licenses for OER. Both licenses meet the strict requirement of the open definition and also have been approved for free cultural works by Creative Commons.\
\
The OER World Map project neither will try to provide a final answer to the question, which licenses are to be considered open, nor will it collect only services which provide open licensed materials. Instead we will try to provide orientation by including an “openness indicator” which will focus on licensing in the beginning and which could be extended to other questions like file formats in the future.\
\
More information about the use of open content licenses can be found <a href="https://www.unesco.de/fileadmin/medien/Dokumente/Kommunikation/Open_Content_A_Practical_Guide_to_Using_Open_Content_Licences_web.pdf">here</a>.\
\
<b> Is the use of open licenses a necessary condition to be included in the OER World Map?</b>\
\
The most common OER Definitions by The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and by UNESCO compulsory require the use of open licenses. “Free” or “gratis” resources (resources which are accessible without any cost on the internet but not openly licensed) are not OER according to these definitions. We take this requirement very serious since according to our understanding the idea of reusing and modifying resources is central to the concept of OER. We also believe that by focussing on openly licensed material the OER World Map will provide real value to users, who are looking for reusable material. We also hope that by highlighting the use of open licenses, services which provide free material will be motivated to adopt open licenses.\
\
Nevertheless we don`t think that it makes sense to exclude free services completely, since the gratis offerings of today might become the openly licensed services of tomorrow. Therefore the OER World Map will be open to record non-open websites and services as well, but they will be clearly marked by using &lt; href=”https://github.com/hbz/oerworldmap/issues/237&gt;an openness indicator. The default search and display options will be limited to open materials only.\
\
We also believe that projects should be handled more liberal than services. Many projects might aim at goals related to Open Education in the wider sense and provide results which are valuable to the OER movement, even if they do not provide open licensed materials. This is especially true, since the concepts of OER, Open Educational Practises and Open Education are still imperfectly defined and underlying continual change. To avoid excluding valuable projects, we believe that the OER World Map should be open to all projects which consider themselves to contribute to the field of Open Education.\
\
<b>What kind of licenses do you use?</b>\
\
<b>Is the only way to include data into the OER World Map by writing a story?</b>\
\
No. We are planning two major ways to input data into the system. On the one hand it will be possible to input data manually by templates. On the other hand it will be possible to do automatic batch imports using our API. In order to publish a functional version of the system as early as possible we decided to start with stories which can be send in by email. This was merely an interims solution. We plan to provide templates with v0.3, which is scheduled for mid-September 2015.\
\
<b>Will the OER World Map include MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses)?</b>\
\
This is an interesting question. The simple answer will be “Yes!”. But things are more complicated, if you look at it in more detail:\
<ul>\
	<li>It has been criticised frequently that many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOC</a> are not using openly licensed material, which makes them “free” (gratis) but not really “open”. As stated above, the World Map can also include non-open services and materials. This is true for MOOC as well. But if a MOOC does not provide open resources, it will be classified accordingly using the “openness indicator”.</li>\
	<li>One could also argue, that MOOC are courses, which are using and providing OER (if open licenses are used), but that this does not make them OER themselves. Indeed we believe that MOOC might be classified rather as Open Educational Practices (OEP), than OER. Nevertheless since there is an obvious connection between MOOC and OER and since we are aiming at including OEP`s as well in the long run, we believe, that it makes sense to include MOOC as well.</li>\
	<li>Last but not least the OER World Map does not attempt to collect individual resources during phase II of the project. This is also true for MOOC. So the minimal goal right now will be to include MOOC-platforms like Openup Ed or Coursera. Individual MOOC presentations might be visualized as events on a calendar in a later stage of the project. It will also be possible to include stories about MOOC</li>\
</ul>\
<b>How will you use any information I share? </b>\
\
We believe data privacy to be an important issue. You can find information about our legal and privacy policy <a href="https://oerworldmap.org/#imprint">here</a>.\
\
<b>Do you want to hear from students as well as educators? </b>\
\
We are interested in hearing from anyone with a good story to tell about OER and how it has made a difference to them.\
\
<b>What does it mean to become a country champion?</b>\
\
Country champions help to map the OER world by country – gathering data and raising awareness of the project. Check out our <a href="https://oerworldmap.wordpress.com/2015/04/17/what-does-it-mean-to-become-a-country-champion/">blog post</a> for more information about the country champion initiative. If you are interested in acting as champion for your country, please do not hesitate to contact us.\
\
<b>Will the OER Word Map be available in several languages?</b>\
\
The initial version of the website will be developed in English. Nevertheless, we believe that in the long run the siteshould be available in many languages and the system is prepared to support multilinguality. (Automatic translation does not work perfectly yet but it's in the plan). If you are interested in translating the website into your own language, please contact us.\
