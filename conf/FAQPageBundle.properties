<b>What is this website?</b> \
The OER World Map shares information on behalf of the worldwide OER community, using local knowledge to describe the OER ecosystem. Built with cutting edge linked open data technology, OER World Map visualizes the world of OER and supports a range of widgets and tools with powerful statistical analysis. OER World Map is built by <a href="https://www.hbz-nrw.de/">hbz</a> and <a href="http://www.graphthinking.com/">graphthinking GmbH</a> in association with <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">The Open University (UK)</a> with funding from <a href="http://www.hewlett.org/">The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</a>.\

<b>What is OER? </b>\
'OER' stands for 'Open Educational Resources' and this refers to freely accessible materials that can be used for a range of activities around teaching and learning. These can include textbooks, multimedia content, curricula and assessment materials, lessons plans, data sets and other materials. What makes them open is typically an 'open' licence instead of a traditional copyright licence. Depending on the licence this allows for a range of behaviours sometimes known as the <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/3221">'5 Rs' of openness</a>:\
<ul>\
	<li>Retain – the right to make, own, and control copies of the content</li>\
	<li>Reuse – the right to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a video)</li>\
	<li>Revise – the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (e.g., translate the content into another language)</li>\
	<li>Remix – the right to combine the original or revised content with other open content to create something new (e.g., incorporate the content into a mashup)</li>\
	<li>Redistribute – the right to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (e.g., give a copy of the content to a friend)</li>\
</ul>\
There is sometimes debate over what should be considered an Open Educational Resource. Although some people consider the use of an open file format to be an essential characteristic of OER, this is not a universally acknowledged requirement. The <a href="http://www.hewlett.org/programs/education/open-educational-resources">Hewlett Foundation</a> consider OER to be "high-quality, openly licensed, online educational materials that offer an extraordinary opportunity for people everywhere to share, use, and reuse knowledge" and this is the definition used in this project:\
<blockquote>OER are teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property license that permits their free use and re-purposing by others. Open educational resources include full courses, course materials, modules, textbooks, streaming videos, tests, software, and any other tools, materials, or techniques used to support access to knowledge.</blockquote>\
If you want to learn more about the history and use of OER then a useful video playlist is provided by <a href="http://oerresearchhub.org/2013/09/25/understanding-oer-in-10-videos/">OER Research Hub</a>. More information about the use of open content licenses can be found <a href="https://www.unesco.de/fileadmin/medien/Dokumente/Kommunikation/Open_Content_A_Practical_Guide_to_Using_Open_Content_Licences_web.pdf">here</a>.\
\
<b>Who is this website for?</b>\
The OER World Map provides helpful information for everyone who is interested in OER. Especially we will focus on three main use cases ("epics"):\
<ol>\
	<li>Teachers and learners should be provided with a qualified list of OER services in order to help them finding OER resources more easily.</li>\
	<li>OER initiatives should be supported in their communication by finding OER experts and projects working on similar tasks.</li>\
	<li>OER Policy makers should be supported by statistics derived from the data basis.</li>\
</ol>\
An overview of all existing use cases can be found on our <a href="https://github.com/hbz/oerworldmap/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Astorygithub">Github system</a>. If you think anything is missing here, please tell us so!\
\
<b>How can I participate in OER World Map?</b>\
There are many ways to be involved! At the moment the following functionality is enabled:\
<ul>\
	<li>contributing and reading stories</li>\
	<li>becoming a country champion</li>\
	<li>contributing use-cases, so that we can develop the system according to the real needs of the OER community</li>\
	<li>browsing the map to find stories, organisations and people near you</li>\
	<li>translating the web pages</li>\
</ul>\
Later on it will be also possible for registered users to input data directly in the system. This functionality is planned for Version 0.3.\
\
<b>What kind of information does OER World Map collect?</b>\
The OER World Map collects data related to OER. During phase II (which is going till the end of 2015) we will not collect information about specific OER, but concentrate instead on the infrastructure around OER. We are particularly interested in:\
<ul>\
	<li>organizations</li>\
	<li>projects</li>\
	<li>services</li>\
	<li>persons</li>\
	<li>events</li>\
</ul>\
This list is not complete and will be expanded regularly. For example we are thinking about including Open Educational Practises and OER policies.\
\
We take licensing very seriously in order to avoid "open washing" where a resource is described as 'open' but is not in fact openly licensed. A resource which is freely accessible, but not openly licensed cannot be reused by other people. Nevertheless, there might be cases in which a project or a service will be relevant to Open Education and Open Educational practices, without having a specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources#Licensing_and_types_of_OER">open licence</a>. Since it is very difficult to formulate general rules, these cases have to be decided case by case. If you are not sure whether your story/information is relevant to the OER World Map, please contact us.\
\
<b>Can I send you a ‘story’ about my MOOC (Massively Open Online Course)? </b>\
We welcome new 'stories' and we are keen to help everyone share their experiences with the world. We are interested in hearing about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOC</a>, but it should be noted that although most MOOC are 'open' to anyone to sign up and take the course they are not necessarily 'open' in terms of licensing. So a MOOC qualifies as OER when the course materials are freely available on an open licence but not if the materials themselves are copyrighted (regardless of whether other aspects of a MOOC are arguably 'open'. If in doubt, please get in touch.\
\
<b>How will you use any information I share? </b>\
You can find information about our legal and privacy policy <a href="https://oerworldmap.org/#imprint">here</a>.\
\
<b>Do you want to hear from students as well as educators? </b>\
We are interested in hearing from anyone with a good story to tell about OER and how it has made a difference to them.\
\
<b>What does it mean to become a country champion?</b>\
Country champions help to map the OER world by country – gathering data and raising awareness of the project. Check out our blog post '<a href="https://oerworldmap.wordpress.com/2015/04/17/what-does-it-mean-to-become-a-country-champion/">' for more about the country champion initiative. If you are interested in acting as champion for your country, please do not hesitate to contact us</a>\
\
<b>Will the OER Word Map be available in several languages?</b>\
The initial version of the site will be developed in English. Nevertheless, we believe that in the long run the page should be available in many languages and the system is prepared to support multilinguality. (Automatic translation does not work perfectly yet but it's in the plan). If you are interested in translating the website into your own language, please contact us.\
